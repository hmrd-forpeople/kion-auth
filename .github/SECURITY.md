## Supported Versions

Generally speaking, only the latest version is supported. If there are any other supported versions, they will be listed in the table below.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, file an [issue on github](https://github.com/hmrd-forpeople/kion-auth/issues). As this is an open-source project with very little activity, we make no promises on response time, and we definitely do not offer anything like a bug bounty (unless you count our thanks as a bounty).
